# Development logs

## Personal requirements

Since the requirements are to build a **production ready** component, I will focus more on the development, otherwise I would have spent more time at the beginning using **npm workspaces** to setup a repository for a real react component ready to be published on npmjs.org.

1- **Creation of the project** with `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_LOGS.md` file, as well as the basic create-react-app setted up with typescript
2- **Creation of the structure of the project** with the core `./compoents` folder and the Homepage ready to load the autocomplete.
3- **Main functionalities developed** A simple autocomplete component with tests
4- **All requirements are matched** Such as highlight of the researched term, usability and production ready code, non-standard/edge use-cases.
5- **Final README.md prepared** with final notes and everything.
6- **questions.md** prepared with all the answers. _Even here,_ I'll try to commit every answer so you can see the time spent in each one. 


### 1 - Creation of the project 

- Main decisions are taken, let's start!


### 2 - Creation of the structure of the project

- I decided that I will create a component that it will be re-usable. 
- I will start with the simple tinterface. Keeping in mind the usability (it will need to work with arrows and everything)
